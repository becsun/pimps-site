## :star2: MyApp

My project was to build a website for my first client who has a salon based in Shoreditch, London.


### Application overview
 The client requested to have a few extra features of listing the products they retailed as well as their staff members. I decided to incorporate 2 other features where the user can search for products that suits their needs as well as the suitable stylist for a desired look.

## :hourglass_flowing_sand: Timeframe

Started the planning the project out detailing all the daily objectives on the Trello board.

Used QuickDBD to figure out the relationships i would have between the staff to the services and to the services to the products.

## :shell: Virtual Environment
Using Python we need to create a virtual environment, a virtual workspace for each project. This is so that you project are isolated and can keep modules separate from each other.

Needed to be run in the command line.

## :woman_technologist: Linking the many to many relationship for the products to the hair type.
I wanted to have a feature to help users find the appropriate products for their hair type. Based on what they chose in the drop down menu bar, the products that are appropriate will be displayed. The code snippet is what allowed me to do so.

## :confounded: Challenges

I found postgreSQL tricker to use compared to MongoDB. I needed to be more structured and make sure that i had all the relationships correct as it is a bit difficult change when there is data in the database.  Using Quick DB helped me visualise all the relationships and how to link one another

## :trophy: Wins
Major win was completing this solo project in a week. Please about hitting all my objectives that i had set out for the website and also met the client's needs. Enjoyed the whole process thoroughly.

## :thought_balloon: Extras
I would eventually like to add:
1. an instagram carousel on each staff member's personal page. It would be a great way to show case their work.

3. Add directions on how to get to the salon.
4. A form in the contacts page for users to send a message directly.
